]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Channel Master Cm-7777hd was created with the goal of becoming the most flexible TV antenna amplifier available on the market at the time of its release. For more than 60 years, Channel Master has been developing, manufacturing, and marketing television antenna amplifiers. Professional installers and industry experts have consistently praised these professional versions as being the greatest TV antenna amplifier models available on the market.</p>
<p>Customers have become more self-sufficient as the business has developed, undertaking their television antenna and home entertainment projects as do-it-yourself projects rather than depending on professional installers more and more. As a result of this development, our team of industry analysts decided that there was a demand for a professional-quality amplifier that was more easily installed by customers. The Channel Master Amplify combines the finest elements of our most successful professional amplifier models with additional features to make it easier for customers to install their own amplifiers themselves.</p>
<h3>Indoor/Outdoor Heavy-Duty Housing</h3>
<p>Competitor TV antenna amplifiers are generally made of plastic and are intended for indoor usage only, according to the manufacturer. The Channel Master Amplify, like our Titan 2 professional versions, is built of a die-cast metal casing with weatherproof ports to allow for installation both indoors and out in all weather conditions. The versatility of being able to install the Amplify both indoors and outside allows it to be used with an indoor antenna while also having the option to upgrade to an outdoor antenna in the future without having to purchase a new amplifier if the situation changes.</p>
<h3>Adjustable Amplification</h3>
<p>The majority of individuals believe that more is better. Nevertheless, when it comes to TV antenna amplifiers, this is not always the case. We see this all of the time when people purchase our highest gain professional amplifier (CM-7777) without first obtaining the necessary signal measuring equipment to establish how much amplification they actually require for their signals. In many situations, an excessive amount of signal will be detrimental to your overall signal and reception quality rather than beneficial. In addition to delivering an industry-leading 30dB of gain, the Channel Master Amplify eliminates the need for a customer to be concerned about signal strength. By including a simple push-button gain switch, you can easily start with the high setting of 30dB gain and, if you find that this much signal has a negative impact on your reception, you can simply push the button and switch to the low setting of 17dB, which will in most cases be a safe amount of gain and make a noticeable difference in signal quality. Because it will be put indoors and immediately in front of a television screen, it is not recommended to utilize the highest sound level (30dB).</p>
<h3>Channel Master Cm-7777HD Offers Flexible USB Powering Options</h3>
<p>The Channel Master Amplifier is equipped with two different powering choices.</p>
<p><em><strong>Indoors</strong></em><br />
Whenever the Amplify is put indoors, it may be powered immediately through the USB power cube that comes with it or by plugging the provided USB cable into an open USB port on a television or set-top device, therefore avoiding the need for direct hookups to an electrical outlet. * Not all USB ports will be able to produce enough voltage to operate the amplifier; thus, you must check that the USB port on your device supports a 5V 1.0A output.</p>
<p><em><strong>Outdoors</strong></em><br />
It comes with a USB power inserter that may be used when the amplifier is put outdoors. This inserter enables you to install the power adapter and injector inside the house near your television, where the power is sent up to the amplifier using your existing coaxial connection.</p>
<h3>LTE and Out of Band Filtering</h3>
<p>A major reason for intermittent television signal interruption is the development of LTE signal towers and linked LTE devices. This is because mobile carriers operate on frequencies that can be quite close to your broadcast TV frequencies, causing the signal to be disrupted intermittently. These interruptions can result in poor signals or even channel loss, and they can be particularly irritating when you are using an amplifier in conjunction with your TV antenna. With the Channel Master Amplify, you won&#8217;t have to worry about anything like this. Built-in filters are intended to rid your OTA TV signal route of typical interference, such as that caused by mobile LTE signals, and to improve picture quality.</p>
<p>If you are a consumer or a less-experienced installer looking for a professional-grade TV antenna amplifier that is easy to install while also providing robust quality and performance, look no further than the Channel Master Amplify. It is a professional-grade TV antenna amplifier that provides a convenient installation while also providing robust quality and performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Channel Master CM 3671 R is an outdoor TV antenna with a high gain and extended range that receives UHF, VHF, FM, and HD signals. This antenna will pick up accessible local channels 2 through 69 and has a signal range of 100 miles. The CM 3671R is ideal for those who live in locations with poor service and need a high-gain TV antenna. Any crystal clear HD signals being broadcast in your region will be picked up by an HD television.</p>
<p>The Channel Master Crossfire CM-3671 is built for the furthest reaches of the fringe; if you live in a location where the signal for a certain tower is poor, the Channel Master Crossfire is for you.</p>
<p>The Crossfire series of TV antennas have excellent gain over the whole bandwidth, making it the antenna of choice in locations with poor service. VHF/FM and U/V/FM variants are available for the Crossfire. This antenna is excellent for receiving OTA HDTV in deep fringe regions with a poor signal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even under significant ice loads, the bigger CROSSFIRE&#8217;s double boom truss structure maintains components in line and avoids antenna drooping.</li>
<li>The double boom is reinforced with high-strength truss boom braces, which prevent structural deformation.</li>
<li>High-wind stability is provided by spun boom ends, which eliminate wind whistling.</li>
<li>For years of outstanding reception, use an all-aluminum phasing crossover harness.</li>
<li>For increased UHF gain, use drop wing directors, a corner reflector, and folded UHF dipoles.</li>
<li>Insulating spacers maintain all parts operating in perfect harmony and avoid shorting.</li>
<li>Long elements have reinforced element sleeves for increased strength at the most stressed places.</li>
<li>For further strength, rear parts are made of heavy-duty steel.<br />
ABS insulators with a long life span provide support even in hurricane-force gusts.</li>
<li>Hardware for attachment to a mast is included, as well as a 75-ohm transformer for coax connection.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Focus Antennas television antenna booster (HAMZA preamplifier) is a mast mounted amplification unit with indoor power supply which connect via coaxial cable. It will amplify digital and HD signals received by your antenna. This antenna amplifier is a high gain, low noise preamplifier used for weak signal areas to allow a weak signal that is present at the antenna to be amplified to a viewable strength. This TV antenna preamplifier works best in weak signal areas and is subject to overdrive if used in areas with fairly strong signals.</p>
<p>The Hamza range of mast mounted amplifiers has been completely re-engineered and updated. These Hamza amplifiers represent the ultimate in preamplifier performance.  Hamza amplifier has a heavy duty die-cast aluminum housing fully shielded, weather proof enclosure and makes up for signal loss from long cables and splitters. Lock in those hard to get stations by placing this as close to the antenna as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Optimum filtering for rejection of out-of-band signals.</li>
<li>Surface-mounted components for automated production and consistent high performance.</li>
<li>VHF and UHF bands combined amplification • Gain: VHF 30 dB &#8211; UHF 30 dB</li>
<li>Includes a switchable FM trap</li>
<li>Outdoor rated housing</li>
</ul>
