<li class="a-spacing-mini"><span class="a-list-item">Nest Wifi Pro is built for Wi-Fi 6E. It&#8217;s up to 2x faster than Wi-Fi 6, so you get super fast speeds and a reliable connection for your entire home.[1]</span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-mini"><span class="a-list-item">One router provides up to 2200 square feet of fast, reliable Wi-Fi.[2] And you can customise your setup for the coverage you need.</span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-mini"><span class="a-list-item">Nest Wifi Pro has built-in technology that makes sure your connection is strong and consistent even at the edge of your network&#8217;s coverage[2]</span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-mini"><span class="a-list-item">Nest Wifi Pro is not compatible with previous generations of Nest Wifi and Google Wifi</span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-mini"><span class="a-list-item">Up to 2x faster as compared to a Wi-Fi 6 router that supports 80MHz channels. Wi-Fi 6E specifications are based on use of a Wi-Fi 6 or later generation device that supports 160 MHz channels. Actual speeds depend on your internet service provider, network conditions, connected device, local regulations and environmental factors. Additional routers may be needed for full coverage.</span></li>
<li class="a-spacing-mini"><span class="a-list-item">Router placement and home size, materials and layout can affect how Wi-Fi signal travels. Poor placement and larger home or homes with thicker walls or long, narrow layouts may need extra Wifi points for full coverage. Strength and speed of signal will also depend on your Internet provider. More than 5 routers in a network may result in degraded performances and is not recommended.</span></li>
